This project is a part of a Research Project under Dr. Colleen St Clair of the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta. 

The aim of this project was to develop an artificially intelligent object-detection model for analyzing data on Roosevelt Elk in form of images and videos. The type of model used was “You Only Look Once”. This method divides the image into a grid and detects objects inside each cell. 
I made use of 4 classes in the final version – “elk”, “cattle”, “deer”, “other” (or not any of these three).
